## Toolbar Icons

The file `toolbar_icon_source.svg` contains the complete set of graphics in different layers. To create an individual icon out of it, follow this procedure:

1. Open `toolbar_icon_source.svg`, e.g. in Inkscape
2. Hide/show the layers needed to compose your desired icon
3. "Export" the icon to PNG, 36x36 pixel size (for Chrome/Edge)
4. "Save as copy" the icon as "Optimized SVG" (for Firefox)
5. Repeat for all desired icon versions

**Note:** The extension will choose the icon to show by _filename_, so make sure that is correct (take a look at the existing icon sets for reference).
